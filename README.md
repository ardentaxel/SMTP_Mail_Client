# SMTP Client

## Overview

This SMTP Client project is a Java-based application designed to send emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It provides a straightforward interface for connecting to an SMTP server, composing messages, and sending them. The project is structured to offer a deep understanding of how email protocols work in a modern programming environment.

## Features

- **SMTP Server Connection**: `Client.java` manages connections to SMTP servers, handling the necessary communication protocols.
- **Email Message Composition**: Utilizes `Message.java` to define and format email messages, supporting basic headers and body content.
- **File Attachment Support**: The project supports attaching files to emails, allowing for a more versatile email composition.
- **Application Interface**: `App.java` provides the application logic, and graphical user interface
- **Command-line Interface**: `Main.java` serves as the entry point, offering a command-line interface for initiating email sending processes.

## Usage

After compilation, run the application using the command `java Main`. This command-line interface will guide you through the process of configuring your SMTP server details, composing your email, and sending it.
